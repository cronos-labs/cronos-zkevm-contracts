## Deploy denylist contract

`` yarn deploy-denylist --contract [=CONTRACT-NAME] [--args [=CONTRACT-CONSTRUCTOR-ARGUMENTS] ``

For example: ``yarn deploy-denylist --contract TransactionFiltererDenyList --args "addr1,addr2"``

## Update denylist

`` yarn update-denylist --contract [=CONTRACT-ADDRESS] --list [=Addresses should add or remove from the denylist] [--remove] ``

To add some addresses to the denylist: ``yarn deploy-denylist --contract [contract-deployed-address] --list "addr1,addr2,..."``
To add remove addresses to the denylist: ``yarn deploy-denylist --contract [contract-deployed-address] --list "addr1,addr2,... --remove"``
